## Wins

- Walmart had some super discounted hand tools that we picked up, knife sets, screwdrivers, gonna keep some and try to sell the rest. Maybe gifts.
- Think I got my weekly layout good enough to start using.
- No energy drinks, pop, or junk food, just black coffee and water.

## What I Worked On

- Started working on a personal project last night, started on the frontend, will probably work on it more later.
- Organized school folders and updated my repo displaying coursework.

## What I Learned

- Walmart has good deals after Christmas, just have to look. $4.50 for a 39-piece stubby set, hot damn.
- I'm good at planning, bad at executing.

## Next

- Work on personal project, build the backend and connect the frontend.
- Study up and prepare for courses that start next week.
