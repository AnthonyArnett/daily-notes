## Wins

- Started a very low-calorie diet to get my shit together. Day 1, but it's been fine so far.
- Showed up and wrote this instead of putting it off.
- Made progress finishing my physical journal alongside this one.

## What I Worked On

- Tried to get the dog out on longer walks, but ice everywhere made that tough.
- Brainstormed Arnett Media - originally focused on websites for service businesses, now considering shifting more toward AI services.
- Helped Emily with the baby as much as I could, but he seems to only want her attention today.

## What I Learned

- Day one is more about starting than doing everything "right."
- Some effort is invisible, but it still counts.

## Next

- Stick to the diet tomorrow and reassess after a few days.
- Keep refining the direction for Arnett Media.
- Get movement in where I can.
- Work on my personal site.
