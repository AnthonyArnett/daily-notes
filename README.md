# Daily Notes (2026)

This repo is a daily log. One note per day. No skipping days on purpose.

The goal is simple: write something every day of 2026. Some days will be wins, some will be failures, some will be “I barely held it together today.”

This isn't a journal and it's not a productivity flex. It's just a place to show up, be honest, and keep moving.

## Why I'm doing this

I'm tired of relying on motivation. This is about consistency and accountability, not looking busy or impressive. Writing a short note every day forces me to actually look at how I'm spending my time and energy.

Some days will be productive. Some days will be a mess. I'm committing to writing it down either way.

## What you'll find here

- One markdown file per day
- Notes about work, health, family, learning, and whatever else mattered that day
- Short entries on most days
- Occasional longer ones if I feel like it

## Rules

- One entry per day, even if it's only a few lines
- No fake or filler commits just to keep a streak alive
- If I miss a day, I don't backfill it or lie about it - I acknowledge it and keep going

## Why this is public

Mostly for accountability. Also because I don’t think progress needs to be sanitized or pretty. This is real life, not a highlight reel.

If you’re reading this later: this repo did its job if it exists at the end of the year, even if some days sucked.
